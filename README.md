# Dino-Jump

## :zap: About
This is my attempt to remake the classic Chrome Dino game using the Godot Game Engine!

## :desktop_computer: How to run locally
I have not yet exported the project. So you'll need to run it using the Godot engine itself. Just clone the repository and import `project.godot` into the engine!

## :grey_question: Controls
Same as the original!
